# CHUNKER_PYTHON
This repository, `chunker_python`, is a Python-based project designed to perform chunking operations, which involve splitting data into smaller, manageable pieces for processing, storage, or transmission. The project is structured to use `pip` for dependency management, ensuring that required libraries are easily installed and maintained.

### Key Features:
- **Asynchronous File Handling**: Utilizes the `aiofiles` library for efficient asynchronous file operations.
- **Command-Line Interface**: Likely leverages `argparse` to provide a user-friendly CLI for configuring chunking operations.
- **Human-Readable Outputs**: Integrates the `humanize` library to present data sizes and other outputs in a more readable format.
- **Cross-Platform Path Handling**: Employs `pathlib` for robust and platform-independent file path manipulations.
- **Asynchronous Programming**: Uses `asyncio` to enable non-blocking, concurrent operations.

### Repository Details:
- **Remote URL**: `https://github.com/abitofhelp/chunker_python.git`
- **Default Branch**: `main`
- **Dependency Management**: Dependencies are listed in the `requirements.txt` file for easy installation.

This project is ideal for developers or systems requiring efficient data chunking with modern Python features and libraries.
